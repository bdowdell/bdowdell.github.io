# Hi there! :wave:

I'm Ben and am a data scientist and software engineer. I believe in helping businesses make *data-informed* decisions. To me, this means going beyond simply being data-driven and recognizing that people and organizations have a lot of expertise and specific domain knowledge. While it definitely sounds catchy, there is danger in being solely data-driven because it doesn't leave any room for trained-intuition or the wisdom of the crowd. My mission is to provide insights from sound data analytics which when combined with expert knowledge results in making the best possible data-informed decisions.
