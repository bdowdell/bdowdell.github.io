# Hi there! :wave:

I'm Ben and I am an aspiring data scientist and software engineer. My interests lie at the intersection of combining programming, data analysis & visualization, statistics, mathematics, and machine learning. I have a background in geophysics with eight years of professional experience in the upstream oil and gas industry.

I received my Master of Science in Geophysics from the University of Oklahoma in 2013 upon successful defense of my thesis. While at OU, I was a member of Dr. Kurt Marfurt's Attribute-Assisted Seismic Processing & Interpretation, or AASPI, research consortium. The AASPI consortium is an industry-funded research group dedicated to developing state-of-the-art seismic attribute software. The AASPI software consists of FORTRAN programs which provided the actual calculations, a C++ GUI interface, and BASH (later Python) scripts to connect the two. One of the AASPI programs I wrote allowed a user to apply residual NMO corrections to prestack gathers. I also built a Python-based GUI which allows inspecting the basic text and trace headers of a SEGY file, the standard format for 3D seismic data. Additionally, I built the [AASPI](http://mcee.ou.edu/aaspi/) webpage which was my first experience in HTML & CSS.

Prior to joining the OU for my Master's, I attended Southern Methodist Universtiy where I received my Bachelor of Science in Geophysics along with minors in both History and Business. During my studies at SMU, I was an undergraduate researcher in Dr. Brian Stump's seismo-acoustic laboratory which is actively involved in verification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) using seismo-acoustic arrays to detect potential nuclear tests. My experiences in the seismo-acoustic laboratory provided me with my first opportunities for time series data analysis, seeking out potential outliers in continuous records that might be events of interest. Beyond my studies in geophysics, I pursued additional interests in history and business, obtaining minors in both.
