# Hi there! :wave:

I'm Ben and I am an aspiring data scientist and software engineer. I have a background in geophysics with eight years of professional experience in the upstream oil and gas industry.

I received my Master of Science in Geophysics from the University of Oklahoma in 2013. While at OU, I was a member of Dr. Kurt Marfurt's Attribute-Assisted Seismic Processing & Interpretation, or AASPI, research consortium. The AASPI consortium is an industry-funded research group dedicated to developing state-of-the-art seismic attribute software. The AASPI software consisted of FORTRAN programs which provided the actual calculations, a C++ GUI interface, and BASH (later Python) scripts to connect the two. One of the AASPI programs I wrote allowed a user to apply residual NMO corrections to prestack gathers. Additionally, I designed the [AASPI](http://mcee.ou.edu/aaspi/) webpage which was my first experience in HTML & CSS.

Prior to joining the OU for my Master's, I attened Southern Methodist Universtiy where I received my Bachelor of Science in Geophysics along with minors in both History and Business.
