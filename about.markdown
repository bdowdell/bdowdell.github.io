# :wave: Hi there!

I'm Ben and I am an aspiring data scientist and software engineer. I have a background in geophysics with eight years of professional experience in the upstream oil and gas industry. I received my Master of Science in Geophysics from the University of Oklahoma in 2013. While at OU, I was a member of Dr. Kurt Marfurt's Attribute-Assisted Seismic Processing & Interpretation, or AASPI, research consortium. The AASPI consortium is an industry-funded research group dedicated to developing state-of-the-art seismic attribute software.
