# Hi there! :wave:

I'm Ben and am a data scientist and software engineer. I believe in helping businesses make *data-informed* decisions. To me, this means going beyond simply being data-driven and recognizing that people and organizations have a lot of expertise and specific domain knowledge. While it definitely sounds catchy, there is danger in being solely data-driven because it instills blind faith in data and doesn't leave any room for trained-intuition. **My mission is to provide insights from sound data analytics which when combined with expert knowledge results in making the best possible *data-informed* decisions**.

I have eight years of professional experience in the upstream oil and gas industry and hold both Master's and Bachelor's of Science degrees in Geophysics with minors in History and Business. My experience has made me very comfortable analyzing terabytes of structured and unstructured data, working in collaborative and multi-disciplinary teams focused on problem solving, and making multi-million dollar investment recommendations to upper levels of management.

My guiding principles are:  
:heavy_check_mark: Simplicity over complexity. Only add complexity as needed.  
:heavy_check_mark: Unless accurate predictability is the goal, choose interpretability.  
:heavy_check_mark: Over-communicate. Check-in often and ask questions. The only bad question is the one left unasked.  
:heavy_check_mark: Collaborate and include. Science doesn't happen in a vacuum, nor does it benefit from a lack of diversity.  
:heavy_check_mark: Under-promise and over-deliver.  
:heavy_check_mark: Data is only as reliable as the manner in which it was collected.  
:heavy_check_mark: Foster an environment where intellectual curiosity thrives.  
:heavy_check_mark: First, make something that works. Then make it better.  
:heavy_check_mark: Test, test, test.  
:heavy_check_mark: Ask for feedback.  
:heavy_check_mark: Have fun, and do good.  

*What can we achieve together?*
