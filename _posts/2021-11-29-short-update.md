It's been a while since I've posted anything (it was a busy summer!) so I wanted to make a quick update about some things I've been working on. Watch for upcoming posts on the following topics:

1. cuffnote - my Python package for modeling mortgage scenarios :snake::house_with_garden:
1. Forecasting monthly average WTI oil price using ARIMA :chart_with_upwards_trend:
1. What I learned in 2021, and what I want to learn in 2022 :notebook:

Going into 2022, I will be more diligent with creating content on a more frequent basis! But for now, my goal is to post blog articles on these three topics before 2021 ends! :sweat_smile:
